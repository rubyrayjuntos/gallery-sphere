# Troubleshooting Guide: Interactive 3D Gallery

## "Not Found" Black Screen Issue - FIXED ✅

The recent updates have addressed the common causes of the "not found" black screen:

### ✅ **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Asset Path Issues**
   - Changed base path from `./` to `/` in `vite.config.js`
   - Fixed relative path problems on static hosting

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added detailed error messages for config loading failures
   - Added debugging console logs to identify issues
   - Improved loading states with visual feedback

3. **SPA Routing Support**
   - Added `404.html` for proper single-page app routing
   - Updated `render.yaml` with correct rewrite rules

### 🔍 **To Diagnose the Issue:**

1. **Open Browser Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Check the Console tab** for error messages
3. **Look for these specific logs:**
   ```
   Attempting to fetch config.json...
   Fetch response status: [number]
   Fetch response ok: [true/false]
   Config data loaded successfully: [object]
   ```

### 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions:**

**Issue**: Console shows `Failed to fetch config.json: HTTP 404`
- **Solution**: Config file missing from build. Rebuild and redeploy.

**Issue**: Console shows `Failed to fetch config.json: HTTP 500`
- **Solution**: Server configuration issue. Check Render logs.

**Issue**: No console logs at all (blank screen)
- **Solution**: JavaScript bundle not loading. Check asset paths in Network tab.

**Issue**: Console shows CORS errors
- **Solution**: Check Render headers configuration in `render.yaml`.

### 🔧 **Manual Testing:**

1. **Test config.json directly**: Visit `https://your-app.onrender.com/config.json`
   - Should return JSON data, not 404

2. **Test assets**: Visit `https://your-app.onrender.com/assets/[filename].js`
   - Should return JavaScript code, not 404

3. **Test root**: Visit `https://your-app.onrender.com/`
   - Should show loading spinner, then either app or detailed error

### 📱 **Expected Behavior:**

1. **Loading State**: Animated spinner with "Loading Interactive 3D Gallery..."
2. **Success State**: 3D sphere with images and controls
3. **Error State**: Red error message with "Retry" button and detailed error info

### 🆘 **If Issues Persist:**

1. **Check Render Build Logs** for any deployment errors
2. **Verify all files copied to dist folder**:
   - `index.html` ✅
   - `config.json` ✅  
   - `assets/` directory ✅
   - `images/` directory ✅
   - `textures/` directory ✅

3. **Test locally**: Run `npm run preview` in `interactive-3d-gallery/` folder

### 📞 **Getting Help:**

If you're still seeing issues, please provide:
1. **Exact error message** from browser console
2. **Render build logs** (if build fails)
3. **URL** of deployed app
4. **Screenshot** of what you're seeing

The app now has comprehensive error handling that will clearly show what's wrong instead of a generic "not found" message.
